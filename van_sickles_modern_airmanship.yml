          - >-
            The Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) divide civil aircraft into four categories: lighter-than-air,
            gliders, rotorcraft, and airplanes.
          - The civil aircraft category lighter-than-air is composed of balloons and airships.
          - The civil aircraft category gliders is composed of unpowered airplanes.
          - The civil aircraft category rotorcraft is composed of autogiros, helicopters, and powered lift.

            notes:
              - Hot-air balloons are used for sporting events and sightseeing.
              - Hot-air balloons use propane burners as a heat source.
              - Hot-air balloon propane burners fill the envelope with hot gases.
              - Hot-air balloons are buoyant because hot gases fill the envelope.
              - Hot-air balloon pilots vary propane burn for alitutde control.
              - Hot-air balloons go where the wind takes them.
              - Hot-air balloons have high fuel consumption.
              - Hot-air balloons have little use as transportation.
          - subsection_title: Gliders
            notes:
              - Gliders are extremely efficient unpowered aircraft.
              - Glider pilots try to find thermals or other types of "vertical wind" to climb.
              - Unpowered soaring gliders have achieved altitudes near 50k ft.
              - Unpowered soaring gliders have achieved distances exceeding 1.3k mi.
          - subsection_title: Rotorcraft
            notes:
              - Rotorcraft use a rotating wing to generate lift.
              - Rotorcraft operate without the need of a runway.
              - Powered lift aircraft achieve vertical flight by varying the incidence of two propellers.
              - Powered lift aircraft behave like fixed-wing in forward flight.
          - subsection_title: Airplanes
            notes:
              - Airplanes use fixed airfoils for lift.
              - Airplanes use internal combustion to produce thrust.
              - "Airplanes are grouped into three major classes: air transport, military, and general aviation"
