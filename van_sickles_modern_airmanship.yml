      - "The {{c1::Wright brother's}} first powered flight lasted {{c2::12 seconds}}."
      - "The {{c1::Wright brother's}} first powered flight traveled {{c2::120 feet}}."

        notes:
          - >-
            The {{c1::Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR)}} divide {{c2::civil aircraft}} into four categories:
            {{c3::lighter-than-air}}, {{c4::gliders}}, {{c5::rotorcraft}}, and {{c6::airplanes}}.
          - "{{c1::Balloons}} and {{c2::airships}} are categorized as {{c3::\"lighter-than-air\"}} {{c4::civil aircraft}}."
          - "{{c1::Unpowered airplanes}} are categrozied as {{c2::\"glider\"}} {{c3::civil aircraft}}."
          - >-
            {{c1::Autogiros}}, {{c2::helicopters}}, and {{c3::powered lift}} are categorized as {{c4::rotorcraft}}
            {{c5::civil aircraft}}.

            notes:
              - >-
                {{c1::Hot-air balloons}} use {{c2::propane burners}} to fill their {{c3::envelope}} with {{c4::hot
                gases}} which generates {{c5::lift}}.
              - Varying a {{c1::hot-air balloon}}'s {{c2::propance burn}} controls its {{c3::altitude}}.
              - "{{c1::Hot-air balloons}} have {{c2::high}} {{c3::fuel consumption}}."
          - title: Gliders
            notes:
              - "{{c1::Gliders}} are efficient {{c2::unpowered}} aircraft."
              - "{{c1::Gliders}} use {{c2::thermals}} and other types of {{c2::\"vertical wind\"}} to {{c3::climb}}."
              - "{{c1::Gliders}} have achieved altitudes near {{c2::50k ft}}."
              - "{{c1::Gliders}} have achieved distances exceeding {{c2::1.3k mi}}."
          - title: Rotorcraft
            notes:
              - "{{c1::Rotorcraft}} use a {{c2::rotating wing}} to {{c3::generate lift}}."
              - "{{c1::Rotorcraft}} operate without the need of a {{c2::runway}}."
              - "{{c1::Powered lift}} aircraft achieve vertical flight by varying the incidence of two propellers."
              - "{{c1::Powered lift}} aircraft behave like a {{c2::fixed-wing}} aicraft when in {{c3::forward flight}}."
          - title: Airplanes
            notes:
              - "{{c1::Airplanes}} use {{c2::fixed}} {{c3::airfoils}} for {{c4::lift}}."
              - "{{c1::Airplanes}} use {{c2::internal combustion}} to produce {{c3::thrust}}."
              - >-
                {{c1::Airplanes}} are grouped into three major classes: {{c2::air transport}}, {{c3::military}}, and
                {{c4::general aviation}}.
